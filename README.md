# connect_4
This game uses HTML, CSS and vanilla javaScript.

The styling is based on the original Milton Bradley Connect Four game.
I even put a little toggle at the bottom to clear the board.

Connect 4 is grid style game where each player takes a turn placing their colored
piece in a column.  This first player to get 4 of their colored pieces in a row wins.
4 in a row can be diagnal, horizontal or vertical.  If the game board fills up before 
either player gets four in a row, then it ends in a tie.

A player starts by clicking on the very top cell of the column they want their
piece to "drop" down.  Each player then takes turns by clicking on top of the column.
Player 1 is red and Player 2 is black.  To reset, you can click the toggle at the 
bottom of the board.
